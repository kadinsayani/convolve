| Version | Time |
| ------- | ---- |
| v1.0    |      |
| v2.0    |      |

## v1.0 - Baseline Program

The baseline program implements a convolution algorithm directly in the time domain. 

## v2.0 - Algorithm-Based Optimization

The algorithm-based optimized program re-implements the convolution algorithm using a frequency-domain algorithm known as the overlap-add FFT convolution algorithm.
